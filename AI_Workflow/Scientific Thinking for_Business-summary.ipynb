    "\n",
    "1. **Become a scientist of the business**\n",
    "    Spend a little bit less time learning new algorithms and Python packages and more time learning the levers that make your specific business go up or down and the variables that impact those levers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Make an effort to understand how data are produced**\n",
    "\n",
    "    If the data come from a database you should ask about the process by which the data are stored. If the data are compiled by another person then dig into the details and find out about the compiling process as well as the details of what happened before the data arrived on their desk.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Make yourself part of the business**\n",
    "    Do not under any circumstances become siloed. Proactively get involved with the business unit as a partner, not a support function.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Think about how to measure success**\n",

Some of these individuals are technical and some are not, so as a good rule-of-thumb get in the habit of articulating the business problem at a level that everyone can understand. *Stakeholders and leadership need to know what you are trying to accomplish* before you begin work. They also need to be aware from the start what *success would look like*."
